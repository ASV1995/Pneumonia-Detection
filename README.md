How to use Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for Pneumonia Detection!

Introduction:

Welcome to the Pneumonia Detection project! This projects provides a straightforward guide to use Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to detect pneumonia in chest X-ray images. CNNs are powerful neural networks known for their performance in image-related tasks, making them a fantastic tool for medical image analysis.

Features:

- CNN Architecture: Explore the implemented Convolutional Neural Network tailored for pneumonia detection.
- Data Preprocessing: Utilize TensorFlow and OpenCV for loading, preprocessing, and augmenting image data.
- Training: Train the model using a dataset organized with the ImageDataGenerator, flow_from_directory, and Kaggle user: thomasdubail.
- Evaluation: Assess the model's performance on never trained test data and visualize the results.

Getting Started:

- Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/ASV1995/Pneumonia-Detection.git
- Install dependencies.
- Follow the Jupyter notebook for step-by-step guidance.

Usage:

- Adjust hyperparameters, model architecture, or preprocessing steps in model_training.ipynb.
- Explore the evaluation process in model_evaluation.ipynb.
- Adapt the code to your dataset or use the provided pneumonia dataset.
